<h1>RIGEL : An OOP using Java11 and JavaFX</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

The goal of this year's project, named Rigel in tribute to one of the brightest stars, is to develop a program for visualizing the night sky, no matter the place, the date or the time zone. 

For example in the image below, the program displays a representation of the sky as it would appear to a person at EPFL on February 17, 2020, at 8:17 pm, looking towards the south, assuming clear weather. 

The bottom red line of the screen represents the horizon, and the letter "S" below it indicates the south. The mouse cursor is placed on the star Rigel from the Orion constellation, which at that moment has an azimuth of 186° (almost due south) and an altitude of 35° above the horizon, as shown in the bottom right corner. Blue lines connect stars that form various asterisms, such as the vertical bowtie one that includes Rigel. This program was developed using Java 11 and JavaFX
